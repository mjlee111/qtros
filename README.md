# qtros
This package is for arm processor PC like Jetson Nano.
This package will allow you to make QT based UI package without installing qt-ros-plugin which is not available to install on ARM PC's.

You can clone this package and use. 

To make this possible, I used MultiThred. I used different thred for ROS, and UI.
